        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>
            I am a Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://learning-systems.org/">Max Planck ETH Center for Learning Systems (CLS)</a>,
            advised by <a href="http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~floriand/">Prof. Florian Dörfler</a>
            and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/mmuehlebach/">Prof. Michael Muehlebach</a>.
            I received my master’s degree 
            in Information Science and Technology from the <a href="https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/index.html">University of Tokyo</a>, Japan,
            in 2024.
            During my master's program, I was advised by
            <a href="http://www.fl.ctrl.titech.ac.jp/member/fujita/fujitae.html">Prof. Masayuki Fujita</a>
            at the <a href="https://www.scl.ipc.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp">System Control Laboratory</a>.
            Also, I was an exchange student at <a href="https://ethz.ch/en.html">ETH Zürich</a> from 2022 until 2023 and
            did student projects
            advised by <a href="https://idsc.ethz.ch/the-institute/people/person-detail.MTQyNzM3.TGlzdC82MjMsMjA4ODk3NDEzOQ==.html">Prof. Melanie Zeilinger</a>
            and <a href="https://control.ee.ethz.ch/people/profile.john-lygeros.html">Prof. John Lygeros</a>.
            I received my bachelor's degree in Mathematical Engineering and Information Physics from the University of Tokyo in 2022,
            where I wrote my thesis advised by <a href="http://www.cyb.ipc.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp/members/tsumu/index-e.html">Prof. Koji Tsumura</a>.

        <h2>Research Interests</h2>
        <p>
            The lack of rigorous theoretical guarantees stands as a fundamental challenge to the widespread deployment of learning-based control algorithms—or machine learning algorithms in general—in real-world systems, especially when safety is critical.
            To make these powerful tools more available and reliable, my research interests are in the methodological and theoretical advancements in learning-based control algorithms and machine learning algorithms.
            Through my research, I hope to combine ideas from both machine learning and control theory, in order to explain and enhance the properties of these algorithms, including performance, adaptability, and efficiency.
