        <h2>Research Interests</h2>
        <p>
            The lack of rigorous theoretical guarantees stands as a fundamental challenge to the widespread deployment of learning-based control algorithms—or machine learning algorithms in general—in real-world systems, especially when safety is critical.
            To make these powerful tools more available and reliable, my research interests are in the methodological and theoretical advancements in learning-based control algorithms and machine learning algorithms.
            Through my research, I hope to combine ideas from both machine learning and control theory, in order to explain and enhance the properties of these algorithms, including performance, adaptability, and efficiency.

        <h2>Past Projects</h2>
        <h3>Data-Driven Feedback Dissipativity of Discrete–Time LTI Systems</h3>
        <h4>Student project, ETH Zürich (Supervisors: Andrea Martinelli, Andras Sasfi, Ahmed Aboudonia, John Lygeros)</h4>
        <p>Dissipativity theory is a powerful framework that describes how a dynamical system stores and
            exchanges energy over time. The problem of designing of a feedback controller that renders the
            closed-loop system dissipative is referred to as feedback dissipativity problem. In recent years,
            major eﬀorts have been devoted to the analysis and controller design of dynamical systems
            whose equation is unknown but can be observed via input-state-output data. In this work,
            we give data-driven suﬃcient conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities for the feedback
            dissipativity problem of discrete-time LTI systems. Moreover, we extend such conditions to
            the case where (bounded) noise corrupts the system and, finally, we show how to employ our
            techniques in the context of decentralized control.</p>

        <h3>Data-Driven Coverage Control</h3>
        <h4>Student project, ETH Zürich (Supervisors: Andrea Carron, Rahel Rickenbach, Anna Scampicchio, Melanie Zeilinger)</h4>
        <p>In the field of coverage control, multi-robot systems are cooperatively deployed to optimally cover
            a certain area based on a “density function,” which reflects the environmental demands. Especially,
            when the environment is unknown, the density function is also unknown, and this problem has
            been studied in the field of learning-based coverage control. One example is the coverage by ground
            robots in an unknown polluted environment. Here, which areas are severely polluted and which
            are not is a priori not known, and the ground robots are required to move around the area to both
            gather information about the pollution and cover the area. In learning-based coverage control,
            learning the density function is a straightforward and widely used method. However, it has several
            shortcomings, including 1. indirect learning, 2. the necessity of an assumption of prior knowledge
            for the density function, and 3. numerical problems. In this thesis, we propose two methods that
            avoid learning the density function and directly compute the subsequent desired position, namely
            the sampling-based method and the Bayesian optimization method. In the sampling-based method,
            each agent goes to the subsequent desired position with a probabilistic perturbation added. In the
            Bayesian optimization method, a cost function, which captures the performance of the coverage
            task, is approximated, and the agents go to the minimizing position of the cost function. Both
            methods are provided with theoretical guarantees, which ensure the asymptotic convergence to the
            locally optimal configuration. Moreover, numerical simulations are given to show the effectiveness
            of the methods. Furthermore, an outlook for future work is given.</p>

        <h3>Optimality of "Stubborn Strategy" in Automated Negotiation</h3>
        <h4>Bachelor's thesis, University of Tokyo (Supervisor: Koji Tsumura)</h4>
        <p>In this study, we deal with bilateral automatic negotiation and examine the fundamental properties of the optimal offer sequence under a new model. The space of offers and the value of utilities of both players are continuous and we consider a simplified situation in which both utility functions of the two players are affine. Then, we theoretically show that “stubborn negotiation strategy,” which is to stubbornly make a selfish proposal at the beginning of a negotiation process, and to make a compromise proposal toward the end of the negotiation, is reasonable in terms of optimality with respect to their utilities. We also quantify the stubbornness and discuss the relationship between the stubbornness and the parameters of the utility function.</p>
